# Raba

Raba is a simple, modern DeFi app on Solana that lets anyone:
- Connect a wallet (Phantom, Solflare) and see their portfolio in USD
- Borrow against supplied assets while monitoring a live Health Factor
- View a transparent Credit Score (20% of the wallet’s 30‑day average USD balance)
- Paste any wallet address to look up its balance and computed score
- Explore an educational landing page explaining how lending, borrowing, and risk work
